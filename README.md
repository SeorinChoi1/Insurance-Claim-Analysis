##  Insurance Claim Analysis â€“ Python Portfolio Project ##

This project analyzes insurance claim data using Python to explore how factors like gender and BMI influence claim amounts.


-- What Was Analyzed
Insurance claim values by gender
Comparison of BMI across genders
Relationship between BMI and claim amount


-- Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ for data analysis and visualization


ðŸ“Œ Key Findings
1.On average, males have slightly higher claim amounts than females.
2.The BMI of male customers is higher, which may contribute to increased health risks and higher claims.
3.This suggests a correlation between higher BMI and higher claim values, explaining the gender-based difference.
